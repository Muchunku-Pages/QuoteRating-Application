## Built With

* Typescript - This is a subset of JavaScript that enables strict static typing of variables
 It is used to develop the Angular DOM(Document Object Manipulation) code logic and to facilitate  the creation of Angular Objects and Components from modules and manipulation of those Objects using various methods and custom functions to implement data-binding and event-binding in the QuoteRating web application.

* HTML - For specifying the the structural and content layout of the web application template and how it is to be rendered by a browser.

* CSS - Styles the template by applying formatting to the template elements and their layout. 

* Bootstrap- Special CSS libraries used to generate standardized pre-styled HTML Elements and add predictable formatting when styling webpages template elements.

##Known Bugs

There's a minor bug as relates to the predicting the author name in the Application's modal form that causes the input control to display previously entered Author names

Also the functionality for displaying the topmost votes garnered was excluded due to the complexity on its formulation and debugging given the application's delivery time constraints.
